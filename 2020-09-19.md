# ML ART on Data Fest 2020 Schedule

## September 19

### 16:00 [Alexander Mordvintsev](https://twitter.com/zzznah)
Alexander will talk about Differentiable Self-Organisation with Neural Cellular Automata.
Differentiable Self-Organisation is a practical way of designing distributed systems of locally communicating agents working together towards reaching a shared goal. Neural Cellular Automata are examples of such systems. During this session Iâ€™m going to give a glimpse of the â€œbehind the stageâ€œ process of designing and training Neural CA.

### 17:00 [Roman Kosovichev](https://www.artlebedev.com/romandkos/)
Roman will talk about the first in the world non-existed designer with real satisfied customers and how AI replaces humans in the design and creative fields. Would machines lead to new art-direction processes?


### 18:00 [Evgeny Kashin & Yuri Viazovetskyi](https://mlart.org/datafest)
Evgeny and Yuri will discuss the neural network art gallery, how it is constructed, and how to train the neural network to generate paintings. We will also talk about how to generate not just random paintings, but matching the user query.

## How to participate:
