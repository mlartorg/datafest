# ðŸ¤–ðŸ“šðŸŽ¨Machine Learning Art will take part in Data Fest!
&nbsp;
## [Data Fest](https://fest.ai/2020) is the main Data Science community organized event by [Open Data Science](https://ods.ai).

&nbsp;

### Our goal is to engage Data Scientists in the process of creating objects and tools of modern media and technological art. Creating collaborations between artists and scientists.
### During the conference we will hold several meetups with talks from various artists working with machine learning. 


&nbsp;


# October 3 Schedule:

&nbsp;

## 16:00 MSK [Nikita Panin](https://nikitapanin.com/)
Nikita Panin is a multidisciplinary artist from St. Petersburg. 

&nbsp;

## 17:00 MSK [Olesya Ilenok](https://www.instagram.com/wall_for_scroll/)
Olesya will tell about the WALL FOR SCROLL PROJECT -- practice of street art in the digital layer of the city Vladivostok, Russia. 

Based on the changes in the city and the notion of public space with the development of digital technology, the practice preserves such important ethical aspects of street art as anonymity, the sudden encounter of the artist with the viewer, and site-specificity. 

Text messages are created by an algorithm based on 5,000 inscriptions from Russian streets, and the resulting images are processed using a neural network.

&nbsp;


## 18:00 MSK [Alexandr Notchenko](https://github.com/gangiman)

Alexandr  will give a talk about class of GLOW probabilistic models and their application to capture motion information associated with speech. 

How to compute gesticulations for speech signals and what meaning lies behind it. Can we create animation for arbitrary signal or animate arbitrary 3D models ?  

All of these questions and more will be discussed in the talk.

&nbsp;

## 19:00 MSK [Vadim Epstein](http://eps.here.ru/)

Vadim Epstein will talk about the "dark side" of StarGAN2. one of the top quality networks for image transformations.

it has been constructed originally to translate photo-real images between domains - cats to dogs, men to women, etc. we'll discuss its' capabilities for wider art applications - from simple stylizing to the creation of enigmatic near-abstract imagery. 

The talk is illustrated with the fresh artworks.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# September 19 Schedule:

&nbsp;

## 16:00 MSK [Alexander Mordvintsev](https://twitter.com/zzznah)
Alexander will talk about Differentiable Self-Organisation with Neural Cellular Automata.

Differentiable Self-Organisation is a practical way of designing distributed systems of locally communicating agents working together towards reaching a shared goal.

Neural Cellular Automata are examples of such systems. During this session he's going to give a glimpse of the â€œbehind the stageâ€œ process of designing and training Neural CA.

&nbsp;

## 17:00 MSK [Roman Kosovichev](https://www.artlebedev.com/romandkos/)
Roman will talk about the first in the world non-existed designer with real satisfied customers and how AI replaces humans in the design and creative fields. 

Would machines lead to new art-direction processes?

&nbsp;

## 18:00 MSK [Evgeny Kashin & Yuri Viazovetskyi](https://mlart.org/datafest)
Evgeny and Yuri will discuss the neural network art gallery, how it is constructed, and how to train the neural network to generate paintings. 

They will also talk about how to generate not just random paintings, but matching the user query.

&nbsp;

# How to participate:
Talks will be premiered in ML Art room in [spatial chat](https://spatial.chat/s/ods). 

Youâ€™ll need to find ML ART room in a room list!

To get a spatial chat invite, please register on [ods.ai](https://ods.ai) website. It will take no longer than 2 minutes, we promise! 

After each talk there will be a live Q&A session with the speaker.

&nbsp;

And weâ€™ll be streaming the whole thing to youtube!
